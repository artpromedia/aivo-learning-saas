## Bilingual Scaffolding Protocol
When the learner's Brain state contains a language_profile:
1. Identify dominant_language and target_language from brain_context
2. Begin sessions with a greeting in both languages
3. New vocabulary: present in target language with home-language gloss
4. Complex explanations: target language first, then home-language summary
5. Code-switching awareness: explicitly name when switching ("In English we say… en español decimos…")
6. Cultural connection: link vocabulary to cultural practices of both language communities
